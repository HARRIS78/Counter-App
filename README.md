# Counter-App
A Counter App use to count the number of events made using Js.

"I recently worked on a counter app project where I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to increment and decrement a counter with a simple and intuitive interface. I focused on creating a clean and responsive design using HTML and CSS, while the functionality of the counter was implemented using JavaScript. Users can easily interact with the app to increase or decrease the count, and I ensured that the code is efficient and easy to understand. If you're interested, I can show you a demo or share more details about the specific features and functionalities I implemented."
